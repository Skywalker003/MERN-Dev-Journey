    <summary>A MERN stack developer</summary>
    <p>A MERN stack developer specializes in building web applications using the MERN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This technology stack enables developers to create full-stack applications with a single language, JavaScript, for both server-side and client-side development. MongoDB serves as the database, storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format. Express.js is a back-end web application framework that provides robust features for building APIs. React.js is a powerful front-end library for building user interfaces, offering efficient rendering and state management. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server, facilitating the creation of scalable and high-performance applications. Together, these technologies enable MERN stack developers to efficiently develop, deploy, and maintain modern web applications.</p>
